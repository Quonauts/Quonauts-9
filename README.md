# Quonauts 9: Quorantine

This is the GitHub repository for the Quonauts 9: Quorantine Nomic game. This
repository contains the entire game state, automatically updated at regular
intervals; however, it may take up to an hour before it is updated. Do NOT
manually commit to this repository; it should be managed entirely by
[Quobot](https://github.com/HactarCE/Quobot).

Below are links to the current game rules, proposals, and logs.
