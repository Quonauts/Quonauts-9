## #1 — Passed

Add a rule "Quantities" (%quantities) in %root:
> A quantity is a named property with a numerical value for each player.
> 
> By default any unique quantity added to the game:
> * applies to all players.
> * is instantiated at zero.
> * must be an integer.
> * must never have a negative value.
> 
> When a new quantity is created, a subsection of this rule must be created, containing a short description and possible gameplay effects. The description has no relevance to the game.

Add a rule "#transactions" (%transactions) in %channels:
> The #transactions channel may be used to modify quantities, but only in ways specifically allowed by the rules.
